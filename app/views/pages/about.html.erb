<h1>About the site</h1>
<p>
  I am pulling data from the
  <a href="https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/">Poke Api V2</a>
   using the Poke-api-v2
   <a href="https://github.com/rdavid1099/poke-api-v2">gem</a>.
    I am grabbing specifically the Pokemon's Name, height, weight, types, and potential moves.
    I will have three tables, Types, Pokemon, and Moves, each having a names column with pokemon also having weight and height.
    As well as 2 joiner tables to handle the many to many associations between pokemon and types, and pokemon and moves.
